--- SNEAKE ---
An original snake video game by Bella Christoffersen and Ely Merenstein.

-RUNNING SNEAKE-
To run Sneake, you must first navigate your command prompt to the appropriate directory where you have stored the Sneake files. 
In this directory, type 'javac *.java' and press enter to compile the code. 
Once compiled, simply type 'java Sneake' to run the program. 
You will be prompted to select a level, which may be a value between 1 and 9. 

-PLAYING THE GAME- 
The goal of each map is to navigate the snake to the blue circle, while not touching the other objects in the map.
The snake will follow your cursor while it is in the window, and increase its speed the further your cursor is from the snake's head.

-IMPORTANT-
When you select your level, make sure your cursor is not in the game window. 	    
If your cursor is in the window when the game boots, you will likely die right when the game begins, since the snake moves more quickly when it's further from the cursor. 
Instead, move the cursor around the window, on the outside, until it's in a place you can safely enter it without killing the snake. 
If you still struggle successfully starting the level, try restarting it with the cursor already around the position of the snake's head.
